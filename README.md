# Monster Slayer

This is a project built from a project assigned in a VueJS Udemy Course. I added some features of my own, including the inline-flex display of the turn logs, randomized turn orders, and hitting only 60% of, rather than all, special attacks.

For simplicity, since this is a small assignment, I used the CDN to import Vue into my project. To run it, you would need to simply open the index.html file in your web browser.
